- 👋 Hi, I’m @jcc10
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Games, Linux, Photography, and Automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WebAssembly and Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on A HTML / JS multiplayer game like Club Penguin (I can program just can't make sprites, or storyline.)
- 📫 How to reach me black. kitsune. gold. tail @gmail.com (but no spaces.)

I may end up changing my username or making a new one eventually, I originally used Jcc10 when I was 10 and have kind of grown out of it.
